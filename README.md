# Discontinuous-Galerkin

This is the implementation of the example in section 4.1 of my thesis,
you can find the explanation of the development in it:

A Discontinuos Galerkin Method to solve some Differential Equations

Some implementations of Galerkin Discontinuous Method
for diferent Diferential Equations as the wave and the KDV-equation

The basis functions used are Legendre Polynomials due to its orthogonality.
